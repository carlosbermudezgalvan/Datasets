Thank you for downloading the MIAS MiniMammographic Database. By
popular request the original MIAS Database (digitised at 50 micron
pixel edge) has been reduced to 200 micron pixel edge and 
clipped/padded so that every image is 1024 pixels x 1024 pixels.

Feel free to use the database in any of your scientific research, 
but please read the licence agreement first (Licence.txt).

If you have have any questions/comments about the data or would like 
information on how to get the original MIAS Database please contact 
me at the address below. You will be put on a mailing list for further 
information about any upgrades of this database. See also our WWW-page 
at http://skye.icr.ac.uk/miasdb/miasdb.html for updated information.

INFORMATION:

This file lists the films in the MIAS database and provides     
appropriate details as follows:

1st column: MIAS database reference number.

2nd column: Character of background tissue: 
                F - Fatty 
                G - Fatty-glandular
                D - Dense-glandular

3rd column: Class of abnormality present:
                CALC - Calcification
                CIRC - Well-defined/circumscribed masses
                SPIC - Spiculated masses
                MISC - Other, ill-defined masses
                ARCH - Architectural distortion
                ASYM - Asymmetry
                NORM - Normal

4th column: Severity of abnormality;
                B - Benign
                M - Malignant
                
5th,6th columns: x,y image-coordinates of centre of abnormality.

7th column: Approximate radius (in pixels) of a circle enclosing
	    the abnormality.
	    
NOTES
=====
1) The list is arranged in pairs of films, where each pair 
   represents the left (even filename numbers) and right mammograms
   (odd filename numbers) of a single patient.
   
2) The size of ALL the images is 1024 pixels x 1024 pixels. The images
   have been centered in the matrix.  

3) When calcifications are present, centre locations and radii 
   apply to clusters rather than individual calcifications.
   Coordinate system origin is the bottom-left corner.

4) In some cases calcifications are widely distributed throughout
   the image rather than concentrated at a single site. In these
   cases centre locations and radii are inappropriate and have
   been omitted.
